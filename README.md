# UDecidePearlHack
An interactive social harassment awareness game for age group 10 to 17 years old.
We have presented different social scenarios by means of different quests and the choices the players will make in each quest will
help them proceed to new quests. I have implemented the scenario prompting the consequences of adding unknown people in social media.
Similarly, different scenarios can be built for online harassment awareness in this interactive game. The goal is to make the age group 
aware about what consequences can occur by the choices they make in the internet.
